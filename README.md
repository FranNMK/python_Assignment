# Python List Operations

This Python program demonstrates basic list operations, including adding, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element in a list.

## Features
- Create an empty list.
- Append multiple elements.
- Insert a value at a specific position.
- Extend the list with another list.
- Remove the last element.
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Find and display the index of a specific element.

## How It Works
1. Start with an empty list `my_list`.
2. Append the values `10, 20, 30, 40`.
3. Insert `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element from the list.
6. Sort the list in ascending order.
7. Find the index of `30` and display it.

## Example Output
```text
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
